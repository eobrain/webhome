At the beginning of the pandemic lockdown I started assembling some [graphs][3] showing COVID per-capita rates. I started this mostly to hone my web development skills, but I became fascinated by how the visualizations I was creating were revealing facts that were not part of the discourse around Covid.

## The US is currently doing much better than Latin America

![Ranking of highest per-capita death rates][4]

If you look at the top of the current [COVID per-capita death ranking by country][2] you see that the United States seems to not be doing so badly, as many Latin American countries are doing much worse.

## The EU is doing much better than the US and the UK

![Ranking of lower per-capita death rates][5]

However if you look lower down in the ranking you see that the US and UK are doing much worse than the EU (with the exception of Sweden).
