# United States COVID-19 Mortality Rates in Each State

The graphs below show the annualized mortality rates of the COVID deaths, so for example a value of 1% is the percentage of the state's population that would die of COVID if that daily death rate were to be sustained for a year.

The first graph shows the weekly smoothed curves of all the states superimposed, while the rest of the graphs show for each state the daily raw values and the smoothed curve.
