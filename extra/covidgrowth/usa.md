# United States COVID-19 Mortality Rates in Each County

The graphs below show the annualized mortality rates of the COVID deaths, so for example a value of 1% is the percentage of the county's population that would die of COVID if that daily death rate were to be sustained for a year.

The first graph shows the weekly smoothed curves of all the counties superimposed, while the rest of the graphs show for each county the daily raw values and the smoothed curve.
