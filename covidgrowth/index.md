Per-Capita COVID-19 Death Rate Animations and Graphs

* [California](/covidgrowth/rankca)
* [USA](/covidgrowth/rankusa)  (by county)
* [USA](/covidgrowth/rankstate)  (by state)
* [World](/covidgrowth/rankworld) 

Inspired by [this powerful visualization][1] these graphs express the COVID mortality as a multiple of normal mortality.

The graphs show the how many times higher the daily mortality rate is compared to the expected normal rate (using a very rough approximation for the normal rate: that one `1/mortalityRate` of the population dies every year, evenly spread throughout the year).
