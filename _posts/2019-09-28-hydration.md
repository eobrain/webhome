I was intrigued enough by an article on hydration, [Which drink is best for
hydration? Hint: It isn't water][1], which appeared in my news feeds that I dug
up the original paper, [A randomized trial to assess the potential of different
beverages to affect hydration status: development of a beverage hydration index][2],
which seems to be from legit scientists, so I tweeted about it:

This seems to go against the conventional wisdom in the United States, where
people feel the need to drink a lot of water to be healthy.

As someone who grew up in Ireland, I do find it strange how much value Americans
put on water. In Dublin we had very high quality water from the Wicklow
mountains but we did not drink plain water that often. At family dinner we would
not have water on the table, or indeed any drink. Instead we would drink copious
amounts of tea after each meal and throughout the day.

Of course most of the United States gets much hotter in the Summer than Ireland,
and indeed I'm suspicious that the kidney stones I developed within a few years
of coming to the US were caused by me not upping my liquid intake to match the
increased temperatures I was experiencing.

But even in hotter parts of Europe people don't drink as much water as
Americans. Ubiquitous water is not the norm. In most restaurants you have to pay
for bottled water if you want water with your meal.

But I've always been a bit dubious that there is a scientific basis for drinking
quite as much water as many Americans believe is necessary to be healthy, and
I've been suspicious of the assertion that coffee and beer "don't count" because
of the diuretic effect of caffeine and alcohol.

The [paper][2] does seem to confirm my suspicions, and a quick Google search
finds some confirmation. For example the New York Times UpShot column determined
[No, You Do Not Have to Drink 8 Glasses of Water a Day][5], which is confirmed
by WebMD in [The Quest for Hydration][6].

The "8 glasses of water" requirement actually includes all the water in food,
and since the majority of most food is water, you can get a lot of your hydration
needs just from eating. And if you consider water from coffee, tea, and beer you
can easily get all your water needs without drinking actual water.

So, this emphasis on drinking water is a weird peculiarity of American culture,
but it is a pretty harmless peculiarity. Even if the hydration benefits are
greatly exaggerated, it is still good for the health if consumption of water
displaces excessive consumption of alcohol or sugary drinks.
