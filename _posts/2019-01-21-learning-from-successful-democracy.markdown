Today marks exactly one hundred years of Irish democracy.
Formed from democratically elected members, the first Dáil (parliament) met on
January 21, 1919, in Dublin. It was a promising start, with a woman cabinet
member and a Socialist-leaning “Democratic Programme”. But that act of defiance
against the British Empire sparked off a war of independence, then fifty years
as a conservative confessional state, then thirty years of low-grade guerrilla
war to the north.

But the people remained solidly committed to democracy despite the poverty and
political strife, and finally, in the last twenty years, Ireland has emerged as
a wealthy liberal European nation.

Throughout one hundred years, one thing has been constant in Ireland: democracy.

Ireland took the democratic traditions of its ex-colonial power and made
something even better. From the beginning, it had instant-runoff, multi-member
electoral districts which resulted in proportional representation in the Dáil
and a necessity to compromise and form coalitions. Regular referendums are the
norm, and minority populist sentiments from the left and right are represented
in the Dáil, giving a safety valve for political frustration, a safety valve
that doesn't exist in the antiquated first-past-the-post electoral systems of
Britain and the United States.

As Britain and the United States struggle with political breakdown, they might
do better than look to Ireland as a model of democracy.
