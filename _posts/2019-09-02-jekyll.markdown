Well, it’s been about a year a year since I started this blog, and I’ve finally
got fed up with my idiosyncratic static site templating framework that uses the
venerable [m4][1].

I was working on building a better templating language, inspired by the one we
use in Google to power the main Google search page, but doing that was
preventing me actually writing any content for the blog.

So, for now I have abandoned my non-standard approach and have converted to
using the Jekyll static site generator. So now [eamonn.org][7] is generated by
Jekyll, though I have kept the [old version][6] alive with links to the old
versions of the pages (because [Cool URIs don't change][2]).

For now I’m just using the bare-bones default theme, but I’m thinking of working
on making the a little nicer.

And now that it’s easier for me to add content, maybe I’ll get around to adding
old content such as my [Medium articles][3].
