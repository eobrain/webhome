As an experiment, I'm seeing if I can use a navigational metaphor
in which the articles in this blog are arranged left to right.  To
reinforce the metephor I added some CSS animation that slides the page
sideways when you click between articles. I also changed the index
page to list the articles in the blog in a horizontal carousel.  It's
still pretty crude visually.
