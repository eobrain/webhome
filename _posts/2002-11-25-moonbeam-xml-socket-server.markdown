UPDATE 2019-09-04: The "Agile" mentioned here is not the Agile software development methodology that had also been named around this tume.  Rather it was a project I worked on in HP Labs to create a way to develop apps that work in a distributed way across multiple devices. This use model was way ahead of its time. It is now commonplace in, for example, how Chromecast works.
