“History does not repeat itself, but it rhymes” Around the turn of the 19th
Century: the French Revolution and the American Revolution, together with the
Industrial Revolutions killed off the *ancien régimes* with their aristocrats
and divine right of kings.

The land-owning aristocrats lost their power and sometimes their heads.

Just after the turn of the 20th Century: World War I, together with the Bolshevik Revolution and the Scientific Revolution killed off a century of stable interest rates that had allowed the wealthy to live a life of leisure.

The capital-owning wealthy had most of their wealth wiped out.

Just after the turn of the 21st Century: resurgent religious fundamentalism and right-wing nationalism, together with the Internet revolution may be about to kill off a world in which multinational corporations and a technocratic elite thrived among increasing inequality.

What will happen to the technocratic elite?
