On Twitter yesterday I made a [big announcement][1] that I’m moving to a new
team within Google.

For most of my five years at the company I have been working on products for
external developers, first for App Engine where I lead the memcache team, then
for Firebase and Cloud where I worked on privacy, security rules, and serverless
events.

But now I am about to move to the team responsible for the main Google Search
user interface. This is a huge change. I’m moving from infrastructure
engineering to front-end engineering. And instead of building products for
millions of developers, I’m building products for billions of end-users.

And this seems like a good time to make yet another attempt to start writing a
regular blog. I’m going to start by eschewing the complexities of modern web
development, using simple, plain handwritten HTML files. Now that I’m a
front-end developer again, I can practice my skills here.
