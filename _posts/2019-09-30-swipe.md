If you are reading this article on a phone or other touch device, did you know
you can swipe left and right to get to other articles? Go on, try it now. I'll
wait.

This turned out to be easy to implement thanks to [Hammer.js][1].  Here's how I did it.

1. I downloaded the Hammer.js library into my JavaScript directory:

   ```sh
   wget https://hammerjs.github.io/dist/hammer.min.js
   ```

   and creates a new file called `swipe.js` in that directory.
2. I added the following to the HTML template of my article pages:

   ```html
   <script src="/js/hammer.min.js" defer></script>
   <script src="/js/swipe.js" defer></script>
   ```

   This loads the Hammer library and my application code into the web page. As
   an optimization I add the `defer` attribute so that the script loading does
   not block the initial page load: after all this is optional stuff that
   should not slow sown the normal functionality of the page.
3. I already had the following navigational structure in the article pages for
   going to the the previous and next pages:

   ```html
   <nav>
       <a id="prev" href="...">&laquo; ...</a>
       <a id="next" href="...">... &raquo;</a>
   </nav>
   ```

   The JavaScript can pluck out the destination URLs from the `href` attributes
   of the `#t` and `#prev` elements.
4. I added the following to `swipe.js`:

   ```js
   const mc = new Hammer(document.body)

   mc.on('swipe', (ev) => {
     const dir = (ev.deltaX < 0) ? 'next' : 'prev'
     const a = document.getElementById(dir)
     if (a) {
       window.location = a.href
     }
   })
   ```

   This code initializes Hammer.js and sets up a swipe lister. When a swipe is
   detected the code looks at the `deltaX` event property to determine if this
   was a left or right swipe, pulls out the URL from the `href` of the
   corresponding link, and navigates to that link.

This simple solution works fine, but there is no feedback to the user to show
that a swipe has happened. In the next article I'll show how to add animation to
improve the UX.
