    <h1>2018-08-19 From Cloud to Search</h1>

    <p>On Twitter yesterday I made a
    <a href="https://twitter.com/eob/status/1030992239147638785">big
    announcement</a> that I’m moving to a new team within Google.</p>

    <p>For most of my five years at the company I have been working on
    products for external developers, first for App Engine where I
    lead the memcache team, then for Firebase and Cloud where I worked
    on privacy, security rules, and serverless events.</p>

    <p>But now I am about to move to the team responsible for the main
    Google Search user interface. This is a huge change. I’m moving
    from infrastructure engineering to front-end engineering. And
    instead of building products for millions of developers, I’m
    building products for billions of end-users.</p>

    <p>And this seems like a good time to make yet another attempt to
    start writing a regular blog. I’m going to start by eschewing the
    complexities of modern web development, using simple, plain
    handwritten HTML files. Now that I’m a front-end developer again,
    I can practice my skills here.</p>
