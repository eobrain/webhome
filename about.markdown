I'm a software engineer at Google, most recently leading a front-end team making the main Google search results page
easier to navigate.  Previously I worked in the Cloud and Firebase teams
building serverless infrastructure.

Before Google I was at HP Labs working on computational aesthetics, and before that I build software for chip design at Cadence and Bell Labs.

I'm from Ireland originally, and now live and work in San Francisco.

I do not speak for my employer. All opinions are my own.

Pronouns he/him.
