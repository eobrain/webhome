  <div :DEFINE:TEXT>

    <p>On Twitter yesterday I made a
      <a href="https://twitter.com/eob/status/1030992239147638785">big
	announcement</a> that I’m moving to a new team within Google.</p>
    
    <p>For most of my five years at the company I have been working on
      products for external developers, first for App Engine where I
      lead the memcache team, then for Firebase and Cloud where I
      worked on privacy, security rules, and serverless events.</p>
    
    <p>But now I am about to move to the team responsible for the main
      Google Search user interface. This is a huge change. I’m moving
      from infrastructure engineering to front-end engineering. And
      instead of building products for millions of developers, I’m
      building products for billions of end-users.</p>
    
    <p>And this seems like a good time to make yet another attempt to
      start writing a regular blog. I’m going to start by eschewing
      the complexities of modern web development, using simple, plain
      handwritten HTML files. Now that I’m a front-end developer
      again, I can practice my skills here.</p>
