    <p>So, I started off trying to have this blog using simple plain
      hand-written HTML. However, I soon start getting annoyed how
      much repeated boilerplate I had to write, such as in
      the <code>&lt;head></code> and in linking together the articles
      from the main index page. So in an effort to make things more
      DRY I considered what simple templating systems I could
      used.</p>

    <p>A long time ago, back before the web existed I used
      the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/m4/manual/m4.html">M4
      macro language</a>. It has the advantage of being installed on
      my home Linux machine by default, so no extra dependencies are
      required. Let's see if we can use it as an HTML templating
      language.</p>

    <p>You can see an example of
      a <a href="https://github.com/eobrain/webhome/blob/master/templates/2018-08-21.html">template
      using M4</a> in the source code of this blog. Note that there is
      just one simple line of boilerplate at the top and some closing
      parenthesis at the bottom, but otherwise the template is
      straightforward HTML.

      The templates uses two M4 files:
      <ol>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/eobrain/webhome/blob/master/templates/lib.html">lib.html</a>
	  which contains the HTML header and footers for all the
	  pages.</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/eobrain/webhome/blob/master/templates/data.m4">data.m4</a>
	  which contains the metadata for the pages, including the
	  information needed to create the home page and to provide
	  "previous" and "next" links on the article pages.</li>
      </ol>
