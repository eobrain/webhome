<p>Consider a typical tech workplace where there are four men for
  every woman.⁽¹⁾ Assume that women and men both exhibit bias to
  members of other genders at the same rate. Then women will
  experience gender bias at a rate of sixteen times more than men.</p>

<p>Yes, a simple mathematical model shows minority experience of bias
  relative to the majority experience goes up with the square of how
  underrepresented they are.</p>

<p>To take another example from the tech world, underrepresented
  minorities (Black, Latinx, Native American) are outnumbered
  typically at a ratio of twenty to one.⁽¹⁾ Again assuming racial bias
  happens both ways at the same rate, the model shows that the
  underrepresented minorities will experience racially biased behavior
  four hundred times more often than members of other groups.</p>

<p>This model could be part of the explanation for why so many members
  of the majority do not see bias in the workplace⁽²⁾. A white man
  might not realize that some particular type of bias that he only
  experiences once a year might be experienced much more frequently by
  minorities: perhaps more than once a month by his women colleagues
  and more than once a day by his colleagues from underrepresented
  minorities.</p>

<p>The model applies to all kinds of biased acts ranging from small
  acts of exclusion and unconscious bias to full-on racial prejudice
  and sexual harassment. At every level of severity, it predicts
  marked increases in the expected frequency of the experienced bias
  with lower minority representation.</p>

<p>Of course, this model grossly simplifies the real world. Gender and
  race are not binaries. There are intersectionalities that make
  things more complex. Biased actions are not uniformly distributed
  and directed. One implication is that in practice, the ratio of
  experienced bias might grow a bit slower than the square, but I
  still think it grows faster than linear.</p>

<p>This squaring relationship is known as the Petrie Multiplier after
  its discoverer Karen Petrie. It is explained in detail in an article
  by Ian Gent⁽³⁾.</p>

<p>(Note, I hesitated to publish this article as it reduces painful
  lived experience to cold impersonal mathematics, and I believe our
  first reactions to issues of representation and bias in tech should
  be outrage and a commitment to fix the system. But even as these
  issues divide us, there is one thing that unites us: we are all
  engineers, and at least in mathematics we can find a common
  understanding.)</p>


<h2>Appendix</h2>

<p>(You can stop reading now if you don't care about the
  mathematics.)</p>

<p>Assume a population of two disjoint groups of people (majorities
  and minorities) where there are \(k\) majorities for every 1
  minority. Let the total population be \(n\), so there are \(n \over
  k+1\) minorities and \(nk \over k+1\) majorities.</p>

<p>Assume that people in each group act in a biased way to individual
  members of the other group at the same rate \(r\) per time
  period.</p>

<p>Thus in total, majorities perpetrate rnk/(k+1) acts of bias
  directed at n/(k+l) minorities, so each minority is a victim of rk
  acts of bias.</p>

<p>Conversely, in total, minorities perpetrate rn/(k+1) acts of bias
  directed at nk/(k+l) majority members, so each majority is a victim
  of r/k acts of bias.</p>

<p>Comparing the rate that minorities experience bias (rk) and the
  rate that majorities experience bias (r/k) we see that minorities
  experience bias at a rate of k² higher than majorities.</p>
