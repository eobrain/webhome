<p>Today marks exactly one hundred years of Irish democracy.</p>

<p>Formed from democratically elected members, the first Dáil
  (parliament) met on January 21, 1919, in Dublin. It was a promising
  start, with a woman cabinet member and a Socialist-leaning
  “Democratic Programme”. But that act of defiance against the British
  Empire sparked off a war of independence, then fifty years as a
  conservative confessional state, then thirty years of low-grade
  guerrilla war to the north.</p>

<p>But the people remained solidly committed to democracy despite the
  poverty and political strife, and finally, in the last twenty years,
  Ireland has emerged as a wealthy liberal European nation.</p>

<p>Throughout one hundred years, one thing has been constant in
  Ireland: democracy.</p>

<p>Ireland took the democratic traditions of its ex-colonial power and
  made something even better. From the beginning, it had
  instant-runoff, multi-member electoral districts which resulted in
  proportional representation in the Dáil and a necessity to
  compromise and form coalitions. Regular referendums are the norm,
  and minority populist sentiments from the left and right are
  represented in the Dáil, giving a safety valve for political
  frustration, a safety valve that doesn't exist in the antiquated
  first-past-the-post electoral systems of Britain and the United
  States.</p>

<p>As Britain and the United States struggle with political breakdown,
  they might do better than look to Ireland as a model of democracy.</p>
