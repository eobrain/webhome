title: About Me
---

I manage a frontend engineering team working on making it easier to find the particular thing you want on the Google search results page. Previously at Google I lead teams working on Cloud and Firebase serverless infrastructure.

Before Google I worked at HP Labs, Cadence, and Bell Labs.

And in between the big companies I spent a few years working at a couple of startups, which are long forgotten in the short-attention-span world of tech.

I grew up and went to college in Ireland, on the [North Side of Dublin][1], spent a few years in London in a research labs, before coming to the United States as a contract programmer, thinking of it as a short-term working vacation.

The working vacation extended to many decades, thanks to meeting the love of my life, with whom I now enjoy the delights of living in San Francisco.
